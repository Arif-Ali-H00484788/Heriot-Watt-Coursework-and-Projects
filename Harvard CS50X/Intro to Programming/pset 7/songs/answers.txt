Analyzing the top 100 songs of 2018 from a single listener provides a fascinating glimpse into their musical preferences. The data suggests a diverse taste in music, with a balance of upbeat and slower tracks.
However, this snapshot may not fully capture the listener's audio aura.
To better understand their musical identity, I would propose a more comprehensive approach:
    1) Collect data over a longer period to account for changes in taste and preferences
    2) Incorporate additional data points, such as ratings and play counts, to gain a deeper understanding of their musical connections
    3) Consider supplementary data sources, like social media activity, to provide a more holistic view
By adopting a more nuanced approach, we can develop a richer understanding of the listener's audio aura and uncover new insights into their musical preferences.
